## Architecture

`internal/ca` is the shared certificate package. Shared runtime construction now lives in `internal/operator`, `internal/client`, `internal/server`, and `internal/tpm`, while the seven demo packages under `internal/scenarios/` remain the orchestration layer. Scenario-local adapter helpers (`NewAuthority`, `CreateClient`, `CreateServer`) now live inside each scenario's `demo.go`, with `config.go` and `step*.go` files holding scenario-specific config and flow:

```
internal/
  ca/          – shared: CA service — trust anchors, intermediate CA construction, leaf issuance, PrintCertificateInfo, TLSVersionName, CertPoolFromCertificate, CertPoolFromFile. No file writes.
  operator/    – shared: human operator — persists CA certs, writes cert/key artifacts, builds chain bundles, distributes trust anchors
  client/      – shared TLS client builders for memory, file, and signer-backed identities
  pwsh/        – PowerShell process helpers used for cleanup scripts
  server/      – shared TLS server builders for memory and file-backed scenarios
  tpm/         – shared Windows TPM + CurrentUser cert-store helpers
  scenarios/
    tlsmem/      – one-way TLS,   certs in memory
    mtlsmem/     – mutual TLS,    certs in memory
    tlsfiles/    – one-way TLS,   certs written to certs/tlsfiles/ and loaded from disk
    mtlsfiles/   – mutual TLS,    certs written to certs/mtlsfiles/ and loaded from disk
    mtlsenterprise/ – mutual TLS, intermediate CA, role-specific EKU, DNS SANs, chain bundles
    mtlsenterprisetpm/ – mutual TLS, enterprise PKI + client key in Windows cert store + TPM (Windows only)
    mtlstpm/     – mutual TLS,    server: files in certs/mtlstpm/; client: Windows cert store + TPM (Windows only)
```

Each demo package keeps the same high-level responsibilities, but the constructor adapters now live in `demo.go`:

| File        | Role |
|-------------|------|

| `demo.go`   | `RunDemo()` plus scenario-local `NewAuthority` / `CreateClient` / `CreateServer` helpers |
| `config.go` | Scenario-specific config structs and TOML loaders |
| `step*.go`  | Scenario step orchestration for the larger demos |

`cmd/main.go` is a thin dispatcher: it reads `os.Args[1]` (`tlsmem`, `mtlsmem`, `tlsfiles`, `mtlsfiles`, `mtlsenterprise`, `mtlsenterprisetpm`, or `mtlstpm`) and calls the appropriate `RunDemo()`. No arg → usage error; unknown arg → error. No default. `mtlsenterprisetpm` is dispatched via `cmd/mtlsenterprisetpm_windows.go` (calls `mtlsenterprisetpm.RunDemo()`) / `cmd/mtlsenterprisetpm_other.go` (returns a "Windows only" error). `mtlstpm` is dispatched via `cmd/mtlstpm_windows.go` (calls `mtlstpm.RunDemo()`) / `cmd/mtlstpm_other.go` (returns a "Windows only" error) to keep build constraints out of `main.go`.

## Key Conventions

**`internal/ca` is the shared certificate package.** `ca.Authority` is the CA service abstraction with `NewSimple(cfg)` / `NewEnterprise(cfg)` constructors and `TrustAnchor()`, `Intermediate()`, `SignServerCSR()`, `SignClientCSR()`, and `SignClientCertForKey()` methods. Lower-level builders like `ca.CreateServerCSR`, `ca.CreateClientCSR`, `ca.CreateCA`, `ca.CreateRootCA`, `ca.CreateLeafCertAndKey`, `ca.GenerateLeafCertificateAndKey`, `ca.PrintCertificateInfo`, `ca.TLSVersionName`, `ca.CertPoolFromCertificate`, and `ca.CertPoolFromFile` remain available for scenario-local or advanced flows. The `ca` package has no file writes. Demo packages import it as `"github.com/miroslav-matejovsky/go-mtls-demo/internal/ca"`. Certificates include SKID/AKID extensions and random serial numbers.

**`signerFunc` / `ca.SignerFunc` closure pattern.** `ca.CreateCA()` returns a `SignerFunc` — a compatibility helper that signs leaf certificates with the CA's private key without exposing the key itself. New CSR-based flows should use `ca.CreateServerCSR` / `ca.CreateClientCSR` plus `ca.Authority.SignServerCSR` / `SignClientCSR` instead of bypassing the request layer. Always pass the signer through; never expose the raw CA key outside `internal/ca`.

**`httptest` for mem-package servers.** In `tlsmem` and `mtlsmem`, use `httptest.NewUnstartedServer(handler)`, assign `server.TLS`, then call `server.StartTLS()`. Never call `server.Start()` — this project only exercises TLS paths. Memory-backed server and client configs accept `*x509.Certificate` + `crypto.Signer` directly — never PEM-encode in-memory keys just to pass them through.

**`crypto.Signer` is the single key abstraction for in-memory mTLS.** Both memory-backed and TPM-backed mTLS clients use `client.NewMTLSWithSigner(client.SignerMTLSConfig{...})`. A plain `*ecdsa.PrivateKey` implements `crypto.Signer`, so the same constructor works for in-memory keys, software KSP keys, and TPM-backed keys. This means the full mTLS client path can be tested without the `internal/tpm` module — any `crypto.Signer` stands in for a hardware-backed key, enabling cross-platform integration tests with no Windows or TPM dependency.

**`tls.Listen` + `server.Serve` for file-based servers.** In `tlsfiles`, `mtlsfiles`, and `mtlstpm`, `CreateServer` returns an `*http.Server` with `TLSConfig` set. The demo starts it with `tls.Listen("tcp", addr, server.TLSConfig)` then `go server.Serve(ln)`. No `httptest` is involved.

**File-based demos use `runDemo(baseDir string)` for testability.** `RunDemo()` calls `runDemo(certBaseDir)` where `certBaseDir = "certs/tlsfiles"` (or `mtlsfiles`). Tests call `runDemo(t.TempDir())` directly — this keeps tests self-contained without touching the repo's `certs/` directory.

**File-based servers use `tls.LoadX509KeyPair`; clients use `os.ReadFile` + `certpool.AppendCertsFromPEM`.** Never reintroduce in-memory PEM bytes in the files packages.

**`certs/` is git-ignored.** File-based demos create it on each run; the directory structure mirrors ownership boundaries (`ca/`, `server/`, `client/`, `untrusted/`).

**mTLS server requires `ClientAuth: tls.RequireAndVerifyClientCert` + `ClientCAs`.** The `CreateServer` in `mtlsmem/` and `mtlsfiles/` takes a CA argument for this reason; the `tls*` versions do not.

**Narrative output style.** `RunDemo()` prints step headers (`=== Step N/M: Description ===`), one-line explanations, then tagged log lines with `[SERVER]`, `[CLIENT]`, or `[UNTRUSTED CLIENT]` prefixes. Use `fmt.Print*` throughout — never `println` (it writes to stderr and interleaves badly).

**All `tls.Config` structs set `MinVersion: tls.VersionTLS12`.** This makes the security floor explicit in every server and client across all packages.

**File-based servers set timeouts.** `ReadTimeout: 10s`, `WriteTimeout: 10s`, `IdleTimeout: 120s` on all `http.Server` structs in `tlsfiles`, `mtlsfiles`, and `mtlstpm`.

**File-based demos use graceful shutdown.** `server.Shutdown(ctx)` with a 5-second timeout context instead of `server.Close()`.

**Private key files use restrictive permissions.** `WriteKey` uses `os.OpenFile(..., 0600)` so key files are owner-only readable.

**Errors are wrapped with context.** Always use `fmt.Errorf("what failed: %w", err)`. `RunDemo()` returns errors; `main.go` panics on non-nil.

**The untrusted-client step in mTLS.** Step 6/6 of the mTLS demo intentionally creates a second CA and a client cert signed by it, then shows the server rejecting it. Suppress the Go HTTP server's internal TLS error log with `server.Config.ErrorLog = log.New(io.Discard, "", 0)` before `StartTLS()` to keep output clean.

**Tests are integration tests.** Each package (except `mtlstpm`) has one `TestDemo` that calls `RunDemo()` and expects no error. There are no unit tests or mocks. A passing test means the full TLS/mTLS handshake succeeded. `mtlstpm` has no test — TPM/Windows cert store operations cannot be mocked.

**`mtlstpm` uses `certtostore` for the client key.** `certtostore.OpenWinCertStoreCurrentUser(provider, container, issuers, ...)` opens the store; `store.Generate(GenerateOpts{EC, 256})` creates the TPM-backed key; `store.StoreWithDisposition(cert, caCert, 3)` imports the signed cert (disposition 3 = CERT_STORE_ADD_REPLACE_EXISTING) — the second argument is the CA certificate (never `nil`; the library unconditionally dereferences it). At runtime, re-derive the key with `store.CertByCommonName(cn)` → `store.CertKey(ctx)` → pass the `*Key` (which implements `crypto.Signer`) into `internal/client.NewMTLSWithSigner`. This also works for the in-memory `*ecdsa.PrivateKey` used by the untrusted client step. No automatic cleanup — demo prints manual PowerShell commands at the end. `//go:build windows` on all `mtlstpm/*.go` files. Dispatch via `cmd/mtlstpm_windows.go` / `cmd/mtlstpm_other.go`.

**`internal/tpm` package.** Windows-only shared helpers for TPM detection, `CurrentUser\My` inspection, provider selection, key generation, certificate import, and runtime signer recovery.

**`internal/operator` package.** Human/manual operations only. `NewSimple(cfg)` / `NewEnterprise(cfg)` create a `*ca.Authority` and persist the operator-managed CA certificates to disk. Standalone helpers cover manual distribution work: `WriteCert`, `WriteKey`, `WriteChainBundle`, `WriteIdentity`, `WriteChainIdentity`, `WriteChain`, and `DistributeTrustAnchor`. File-based scenarios use `type Authority = ca.Authority` and `NewAuthority()` in `demo.go`, then call `operator.*` helpers to persist or distribute the authority outputs.

**`internal/client` package.** Shared TLS client constructors: `NewTLSFromMemory` for one-way TLS, `NewMTLSWithSigner` for mTLS (accepts any `crypto.Signer` — works for in-memory, software KSP, and TPM-backed keys), and `NewMTLSFromFiles` / `NewTLSFromFiles` for file-backed scenarios. Called from scenario-local `CreateClient` helpers in `demo.go`.

**`internal/server` package.** Shared TLS server constructors: `NewMemoryTLS` / `NewMemoryMTLS` accept `*x509.Certificate` + `crypto.Signer` for in-memory scenarios, `NewFileTLS` / `NewFileMTLS` for file-backed scenarios. Includes optional default demo handlers. Called from scenario-local `CreateServer` helpers in `demo.go`.

**`internal/pwsh` package.** Wraps `exec.Command("powershell", ...)` for script execution such as cleanup helpers. No build constraint needed — it just invokes the `powershell` binary.

**Production agent guides and standalone examples.** `example/` contains standalone AGENTS.md files and runnable implementations. `example/mtls/` has enterprise mTLS (certs, operator, server, client packages). `example/winservice/` has Windows service + TPM. `example/container/` has containerized mTLS server + Dockerfile + K8s manifests. Each AGENTS.md is self-contained and can be copied into production repositories.
